# Technocoid v10

This is simple VJ style app. It is used as an experiment to learn more about
UWP in regards to real time media handling.

Note that the goal of this app was not to create a polished VJ app, but to
learn some basics of Windows 10 UWP development. So assume that the code is probably
not the best source of reference on how to implement things.
