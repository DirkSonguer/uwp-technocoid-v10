# Technocoid v10

This is simple VJ style app. It is used as an experiment to learn more about UWP in
regards to real time media handling.

Note that the goal of this app was not to create a polished VJ app, but to learn some
basics of Windows 10 UWP development. So assume that the code is probably not the best
source of reference on how to implement things.

# History

Technocoid was a side project of mine a couple of years ago (2002 or something like that).
It was a simple VJ tool to experiment with realtime graphics (it was OpenGL based), input
(it supported MIDI and some game controllers), and UI. And of course to have a tool to do
VJ gigs. I stopped developing it when I discovered Neon and later [Neon v2](http://neonv2.com/).

Recently I found myself searching for a simple VJ tool that acted a bit like a video step
sequencer, much like Neon did, but I wasn't able to find one. Well, to be honest I didn't
look that long as I figured it would be a nice project to get back into Windows apps and
check out UWP a little bit.
